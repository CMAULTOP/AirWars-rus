# AirWars
Airwars is a unique gamemode where you can build your own steampunk ship and fight with other players.

Gamemode includes:
- Own soundtrack
- Characted customization system
- Big battles up to 15 ships on the field(Maybe even more!)
- No problems with game physics
- Destructible ship system
- Great visuals
- Ability to draw your own flags

# For server owners
This gamemode is really CPU unfriendly. You better go with 4 GHz CPU, or at least 3.6.
